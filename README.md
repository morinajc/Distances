# Public Health and Climate Change - Heat Group

This script maps the centroids of Virginia zip codes or ZCTAs to the nearest Spatial Synoptic Classification (SSC) stations in Virginia and the surrounding states. SSC stations were obtained from http://sheridan.geog.kent.edu/ssc3.html. Once each centroid has been mapped to the nearest weather station, heat event data for each station will be applied to the appropriate zip codes, which allows for spatial and temporal patterns of heat event days for the state of Virginia between 2016-2022 to be assessed. Healthcare claim data will then be analyzed to assess if excess emergency department visits occur during these heat events. In addition, specific heat related illnesses will be analyzed to see if frequencies increase during heat event days.
